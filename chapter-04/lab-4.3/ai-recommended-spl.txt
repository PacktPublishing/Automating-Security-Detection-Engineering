 # Requirements
- The attached contents are from https://allinfosecnews.com/item/environmental-websites-hit-by-ddos-surge-in-cop28-crossfire-2024-01-15/. Parse accordingly.
- Analyze the parsed contents to find indicators of compromise patterns.
- Create a list of file hashes and process syntaxes to look for.
- From the the output, generate a useful Splunk SPL correlation search using Splunk Enteprise Securitys standard data models and CIM compliant

# Parsed contents
A surge in DDoS attacks targeted several environmental advocacy websites during the COP28 climate talks in Buenos Aires last week. Security researchers believe the attacks originated from a botnet of thousands of compromised IoT devices. Targeted sites experienced spikes in traffic exceeding 1 Tbps.

# Indicators of compromise
- Botnet comprised of IoT devices (potentially compromised cameras, DVRs, routers etc.)
- DDoS attack traffic exceeding 1 Tbps
- Targeted environmental advocacy websites during COP28 climate talks

# File hashes and processes 
- Mirai variant malware files (to be determined)
- Processes like sshd, telnetd, httpd (associated with common IoT default credentials exploitation)
